Marseille 1993 (2008)
Sound work by Chantal Dumas
Duration: 6 min 40 sec

In 1993, the Olympique de Marseille football team was a European champion, Pavarotti sang at the Marseilles opera house, and Chantal Dumas made her home in the city. It was a time before cell phones, which makes Marseille 1993 a kind of “retro-sci-fi-documentary.”

Produced by Radio Grenouille (Marseilles, France), the work was commissioned by Étienne Noiseau for the series Coming & Going – Ends & Entries.
