The Piano Tuning (2010)
Sound work by Chantal Dumas
Duration: 14 min 20 sec
Language: English

The Piano Tuning involves the tuning of a piano, a five-room apartment, and a voice. A story evolves, and things happen in it that wouldnâ€™t happen anywhere else. The work evokes listening while revelling in the acoustics of the site.

Commissioned by Marcus Gammel and produced by Deutschlandfunk Kultur (Berlin, Germany) for Klangkunst, a radio program broadcast by the latter.
