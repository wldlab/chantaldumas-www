86400 Seconds – Time Zones (2015)
Participative sound work created
by Chantal Dumas
Duration: 50 min

86400 Seconds – Time Zones uses the human voice to suggest the passage of time. The title of the work refers to the number of seconds in a day. They are counted off, second by second, by one hundred and thirty-eight people aged from eight to eighty-five, in thirty-two languages and dialects. In each time zone crossed, the density of the population on that part of the Earth’s surface determines the number of voices heard.

This work was commissioned by Julie Shapiro for the program Soundproof (ABC Radio National’s Creative Audio Unit, Sydney, Australia) and by the Centre en art actuel Sporobole (Sherbrooke, Canada). Thank you to the time-counters for their enthusiastic performance!
