Tanz (2005)
Sound work by Chantal Dumas
Duration: 50 min
Languages: German and English

Tanz  is a choreography conceived for the ear. Using words and sounds, alternating points of view, and varying scales, this exercise in transcription is a record of multiple bodily states. It is a manifold expression of the dancer’s work and the spaces in which it takes place.

Commissioned by Götz Naleppa for the program Werkstatt and produced by Deutschlandfunk Kultur (Berlin, Germany), the work was created from the text of coït by Chantal Neveu (Éditions La Peuplade, Saguenay, 2010). The production of this work was also supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and Montréal Danse.

[Turntables and prepared surfaces: Martin Tétreault, Saxophones: André Leroux With the participation of Andreas Lange and dancers Karsten Kroll, Carol Prieur, Anna Riede, and Peter Trosztmer, who lent their voices to the project.]
