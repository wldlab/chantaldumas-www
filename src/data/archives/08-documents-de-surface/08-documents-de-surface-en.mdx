Documents de surface (2002)
Sound work
by Christian Calon and Chantal Dumas
Duration: 52 min

Minimal and hyperrealist, Documents de surface slides the way a camera in extreme close-up might glide across the surface of the Earth oron the contrary—across vast panoramas; in other words, wherever anecdote dissolves in sonic material.

Commissioned by Robert Matejka for the program Künstlerisches Feature, this work was produced by DeutschlandRadio (known today as “Deutschlandfunk Kultur,” Berlin, Germany).

Documents de surface was recorded and released on CD as part of the CD box set radio roadmovies.
