    When you hold a shell or an empty cup against your ear, the object acts as a resonance chamber. The ambient noise bounces against the interior surface until it becomes deafening. Underwater, noise rarely hits obstacles. It travels so quickly that it reaches the two eardrums almost simultaneously. This is why we are afraid underwater: we donâ€™t know from what direction the danger comes.
