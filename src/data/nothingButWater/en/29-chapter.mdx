    There is a piano in the entrance hall of our apartment. <br/>It’s the first thing that children notice when they come in. At the beginning of the evening, their parents are convinced that the piano is a godsend, that it will keep the children busy and allow us to quietly talk in the living room. But we’ve never seen a child obey the rule of playing calmly, touching the keys gently.
